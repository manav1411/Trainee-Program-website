            here's what a circle is...<br>
            A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that 
            are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. Equivalently, 
            it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that 
            its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any 
            point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the 
            radius is required to be a positive number. A circle with r=0 
            (a single point) is a degenerate case.
